Munin Plugin
===============

A plugin for munin to monitor the exceptions raised by naxsi is available. It counts the hits by rule id. This way you can prepare in learning mode the WAF and then once a reasonable hit level is reached put it to work.

The plugin code is here: https://gist.github.com/patroqueeet/ed48078de9b758cd35d92fa667894a84

Proposal to munin plugin gallery is here https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/issues/12
